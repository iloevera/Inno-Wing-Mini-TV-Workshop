Welcome to the Mini TV Workshop!  
This step relates to the setup of the workshop, so just 
follow along with the instructions. You'll need to open 
Arduino IDE on your computer, and grab an ESP32, a USB 
cable, some duopoint cables, and a screen.

The below section is for configuring the software for 
your own computer. Fortuantely, we have already done this
section for the computers during the workshop, so you can
skip this section.

If you want to try this at home, you'll need to install
the following software:  
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)  

As well as the following packages inside of Arduino IDE:  
- Boards Managers -> esp32 by Espressif Systems
(Note: NOT Arduino ESP32 Boards by Arduino)
- Library Managers -> TFT_eSPI by Bodmer

replace the User_Setup.h file in This PC > Documents > Arduino > libraries > TFT_eSPI
