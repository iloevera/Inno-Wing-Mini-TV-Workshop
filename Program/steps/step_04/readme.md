This step will teach you to read inputs from your 
rotary encoder.  

<b>Due to problems with the hardware connection, 
please only connect the rotary encoder after your code is 
running.</b> The same applies if you are connecting a button. We 
are sorry for this inconvenience.

Furthermore, due to limitations of the ESP32, only one power 
source can be enabled at a time. As such, please only plug in 
EITHER your USB-C cable OR your battery, as the port may not 
be detectable otherwise.
