<h1>Step 5</h1>  
For the final step of our Mini TV workshop, we
would like you to make your own complete Mini TV
program with the following features:

1. The program connects to WiFi and calls some sort
of API
2. The program makes use of the rotary encoder in a
meaningful way
3. The program includes some new feature not shown
in the example codes (i.e. something besides showing 
the weather or weather forecast, something besides
playing GIFs, and something besides showing the current
time)

<b>Showing the completion of this step to one of our tutors 
means that you will be able to take the Mini TV home. </b>  

We have included an example of a completed Mini TV in our
example for this step, though do note that it uses an 
advanced programming technique known as OOP
(object-oriented programming). We do not expect you to
know this nor copy it, as the same can be accomplished 
with much simpler code.

<b>Make whatever you feel like for this step. </b>  
Good luck! :)
